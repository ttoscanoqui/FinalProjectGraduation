# Design of an artificial vision system in the filling process of the IPA3 Lucas Nülle control station

### There is the code used in my last project as student in ESPOL University, 

    In my graduation project, I worked in the bottle filling station of the IPA26 lucas Nülle plant, 
    which had different stations, by artificial vision, under the opevcv library and code created by me 
    according to the need of the project, we processed the images taken by two cameras, in which it was filtered, 
    at grayscale, and pixel levels, to determine if the bottles that entered the filling station, returned without caps, 
    without liquid or without garbage, by means of pixel counting ranges. I did that segmentation and the results were 
    shown on an hmi screen connected to a PLC, which connected to the cameras through Visual Studio with c # programming, 
    from visual studio the error signals were sent and specifying which bottle of the 6 that entered , entered with a lid, 
    with liquid, or with garbage, and in the event that none of those situations existed, the signal was sent that everything is correct, 
    to start dispensing liquid in the bottles.

## NOTE1: This project were did with my Graduation friend Mark Andrade
## NOTE2: I can't upload the finally code, Because the finally Owner of the project is ESPOL
